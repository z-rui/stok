# stok

This is a simple string tokenizer. It splits a string into tokens, which may include:

- white spaces
- numbers
- string literals
- identifiers
- punctuations

It is very simple and highly customizable. Instead of providing configuration mechanisms, we believe that it is easier to fork this repository and modify the code. It can be used as a starter code of a full-featured tokenizer.

See `example.c` for usage.
